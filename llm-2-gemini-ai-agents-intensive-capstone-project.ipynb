Thousands of clinical studies were launched worldwide in an attempt to understand the virus, evaluate potential treatments, test vaccines, monitor long-term effects, and protect vulnerable populations.\n\nEven though all these clinical trials are **publicly available** on ClinicalTrials.gov, they remain **extremely difficult for patients and non-experts to navigate**. Trial descriptions are written in technical biomedical language, eligibility criteria are long and complex, and searching through hundreds of studies requires expertise, time, and medical literacy.\n\nAs a result:\n\n* Patients often fail to find trials that could be medically relevant\n* Caregivers cannot correctly interpret eligibility requirements\n* Clinicians are overwhelmed with the volume of studies\n* Researchers struggle to identify suitable candidates for enrollment\n\nThe accessibility gap has nothing to do with lack of data — the data is public — but rather the lack of **intelligent tools that make this information understandable and actionable** for ordinary people.\n\n**BUSINESS PROBLEM**\n\n**How can we enable any patient, caregiver, or healthcare provider to quickly find, understand, and evaluate relevant COVID-19 clinical trials, without requiring medical expertise?**\n\nToday, this process is:\n\n* manual\n* time-consuming\n* cognitively overwhelming\n* error-prone\n* inaccessible to non-experts\n\nUsers struggle to answer fundamental questions:\n\n* “Which clinical trials apply to my situation?”\n* “Am I likely to meet the eligibility criteria?”\n* “What is the treatment or intervention?”\n* “What phase is this trial in?”\n* “What does participation involve?”\n* “How do I discuss this with my doctor?”\n\nThis is especially problematic during global emergencies — such as COVID-19 — where timely access to accurate information directly impacts public health decisions.\n\n**3. DATASET USED (COVID-19 Clinical Trials — Kaggle)**\n\nThe project uses the **COVID-19 Clinical Trials Dataset**, a structured extraction of ClinicalTrials.gov XML files, containing:\n\n* study title\n* NCT identifier\n* study type (interventional, observational)\n* phase (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3…)\n* conditions (e.g., “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2 infection”)\n* interventions\n* eligibility criteria\n* study design\n* enrollment numbers\n* start/completion dates\n* sponsors/collaborators\n* study locations\n\nDataset link:\n[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/covid19-clinical-trials](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/covid19-clinical-trials)\n\nThis dataset provides **real medical complexity** while still being manageable for a Kaggle Notebook (much smaller than the full ClinicalTrials.gov dump).\n\nIt contains:\n\n* Thousands of authentic COVID-19 research studies\n* Long, detailed eligibility criteria\n* Rich contextual metadata\n* Diverse interventions (vaccines, antivirals, immune therapies, supportive care)\n* Global geographic coverage\n\nThis makes it ideal for:\n\n* multi-agent reasoning\n* medical text summarization\n* eligibility extraction\n* information retrieval\n* patient-oriented explanation\n\n**4. SOLUTION — Clinical Trials Navigator Agent**\n\nThe **Clinical Trials Navigator Agent** is a multi-agent, Gemini-powered system that transforms raw COVID-19 clinical trial data into personalized, human-readable insights.\n\nA user can simply type:\n\n> “My father is 62, diabetic, post-COVID with respiratory complications, living in São Paulo.”\n\nAnd the agent pipeline will:\n\n1. **understand and structure the medical profile**\n2. **search the COVID-19 clinical trials dataset**\n3. **filter and rank the most relevant trials**\n4. **interpret eligibility criteria**\n5. **generate a customized, patient-friendly report**\n6. **add disclaimers and safety notes**\n\nThe goal is not to provide medical advice but to make **public health research data accessible and understandable**.\n\n**5. MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE**\n\nThe system consists of five specialized agents:\n\n**Agent 1 — Intake & Medical Profile Normalization Agent**\n\n**Task:**\nConvert a plain-language user description into a structured representation:\n\n* age range\n* sex (if mentioned)\n* comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, asthma…)\n* disease stage/severity\n* COVID-19 context (acute infection, long COVID, post-hospitalization, vaccination status)\n* geographic location\n\n**Purpose:**\nBuild a clean, machine-readable patient profile.\n\n**Agent 2 — Retrieval & Ranking Agent**\n\n**Task:**\nSearch COVID-19 clinical trials and select the best matches based on:\n\n* condition keywords\n* age requirements\n* study phase\n* geographic region\n* intervention type\n* enrollment status (recruiting, completed, active)\n\n**Methods:**\nUses custom search functions + LLM reasoning + pandas filtering.\n\n**Agent 3 — Eligibility Interpretation Agent**\n\n**Task:**\nAnalyze complex eligibility criteria from the dataset:\n\n* inclusion/exclusion rules\n* lab value requirements\n* comorbidity constraints\n* treatment history\n* COVID-19 severity definitions\n\nProduces a **fit likelihood** label:\n\n* \"Likely Eligible\"\n* \"Possibly Eligible\"\n* \"Unlikely Eligible\"\n\nAlong with a structured justification.\n\n**Agent 4 — Patient-Friendly Explainer Agent**\n\n**Task:**\nConvert biomedical text into **clear, easy-to-read language**:\n\n* explain trial purpose\n* describe interventions\n* summarize participation expectations\n* highlight key eligibility points\n* remove technical jargon\n\nThis is the main “user-facing” communication agent.\n\n**Agent 5 — Report Generation Agent**\n\n**Task:**\nProduce a formatted summary the user can share with a physician:\n\n* patient profile\n* list of relevant trials\n* plain-language explanations\n* eligibility assessment\n* study phase, design, location\n* disclaimers: “Not medical advice — consult a doctor.”\n\nOutput format:\n\n* Markdown\n* PDF\n* Structured table\n\n(Optional tools can export to PDF.)\n\n**6. VALUE PROPOSITION**\n\n**For Patients**\n\n* makes complex medical research understandable\n* gives autonomy and clarity\n* enables informed discussions with physicians\n\n**For Caregivers**\n\n* reduces confusion and information overload\n* bridges the gap between technical research and real-world concerns\n\n**For Healthcare Providers**\n\n* saves time by automating trial search\n* organizes results clearly\n* improves referral efficiency\n\n**For Public Health**\n\n* supports research equity\n* accelerates patient-trial matching\n* enhances accessibility of scientific information\n\n**7. WHY THIS PROJECT MATTERS**\n\n1. **Increases health literacy**\n   COVID-19 is a global issue; accessible information is crucial.\n\n2. **Brings clinical research to the general public**\n   Not everyone understands medical jargon or trial design.\n\n3. **Promotes responsible AI in healthcare**\n   The system provides understanding, not diagnosis.\n\n4. **High real-world applicability**\n   Governments, hospitals, and NGOs could easily adapt it.\n\n5. **Strong alignment with Agents for Good**\n   Clear societal benefit → accessibility → public health improvement.\n\n**8. ALIGNMENT WITH COMPETITION REQUIREMENTS**\n\n### ✔ Multi-Agent System\n\n(5 agents: Intake, Retrieval, Eligibility, Explainer, Report)\n\n### ✔ Tools\n\n* pandas filtering tool\n* eligibility parser tool\n* code execution\n* optional HTTP search\n\n### ✔ Sessions & Memory\n\n* patient profile memory\n* trial shortlists kept across steps\n\n### ✔ Long-running operations\n\n* large dataset filtering\n* resume/pause analysis flow\n\n### ✔ Context Engineering\n\n* eligibility criteria compaction\n* structured prompts\n\n### ✔ Observability\n\n* logging: matched trials, eligibility decisions, errors\n* metrics: number of trials processed, confidence level\n\n### ✔ Agent Evaluation\n\n* check that each trial explanation includes required sections\n\n### ✔ Use of Gemini\n\n* Gemini 2.5 Pro (reasoning)\n* Gemini Flash (fast filtering)\n\n**9. FINAL PITCH (POWERFUL, 1-PARAGRAPH VERSION)**\n\nThe Clinical Trials Navigator Agent democratizes access to COVID-19 research by transforming complex clinical trial data into understandable insights. Using a multi-agent Gemini architecture, the system converts a user-provided medical description into a structured profile, retrieves relevant COVID-19 clinical trials from public datasets, interprets eligibility criteria, and generates clear, patient-friendly summaries with safety disclaimers. This project empowers patients, supports clinicians, and increases equity in access to clinical research — aligning directly with the mission of the Agents for Good track: using AI to improve health outcomes and reduce barriers in global healthcare.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

Instead, they're often about understanding *how* COVID-19 works, spreads, or affects people and healthcare systems.\n\n*   **Here are a few examples to give you an idea:**\n\n    1.  **Preventing Spread in Hospitals (NCT04376944):**\n        *   This study is looking at **how to best use protective measures** (like masks, gloves, and distancing) to **prevent COVID-19 from spreading within hospitals**.\n        *   **Status:** They are **currently looking for participants** to join this study.\n\n    2.  **Military Policy and COVID-19 (NCT04476680):**\n        *   This trial is examining **how the rules and guidelines** (preventive policies) put in place during **military recruit training might affect how many people get COVID-19**.\n        *   **Status:** This study is **also recruiting new participants**.\n\n    3.  **COVID-19's Impact on Leg Problems (NCT04452682):**\n        *   This study investigated **how the COVID-19 pandemic affected patients who have very serious problems with blood flow to their legs** (called critical limb threatening ischemia) and how emergency care for these conditions was delivered during the pandemic.\n        *   **Status:** This study has **already finished collecting data** and is no longer looking for participants.\n\n**In Simple Terms:**\n\nThese examples show that scientists and doctors are studying many different aspects of COVID-19, from practical ways to stop its spread, to how policies affect infection rates, and even how the pandemic influenced care for other serious health issues. The goal is to gather information that can help us better understand, prevent, and manage COVID-19 and its broader health impacts.\n\n## Medical Disclaimer\nThis report is generated by an AI agent and is not medical advice.\nAlways consult a licensed healthcare professional.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 10.1.

This data tells us a few key things:\n\n*   **Total Research Happening:** There are a lot – **191 different studies, experiments, and evaluations** – currently happening or recently finished regarding COVID-19. This means scientists and doctors are working hard on many different aspects of the disease, not just treatments.\n\n*   **What are Clinical Trials?** Think of clinical trials as organized investigations designed to answer specific questions about health and illness. They help us learn how to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, or understand how they affect people.\n\n---\n\n### Looking at Specific Examples:\n\nHere are some examples of these COVID-19 studies:\n\n1.  **NCT Number:** Each study gets a unique ID number, like a barcode, so you can easily find and track it. For example, `NCT04376944` is the ID for the first study mentioned.\n\n2.  **Title (What the Study is About):**\n\n    *   **`NCT04376944: Barrier Measures to Limit Covid-19.Nosocomial Transmission: a Cross-sectional Evaluation`**\n        *   **In Simple Terms:** This study is looking at how well different \"barrier measures\" (like masks, gloves, and keeping distance) prevent COVID-19 from spreading **within hospitals**. It's a \"snapshot\" study, meaning they're evaluating things at a specific point in time.\n        *   **Phases:** `None` – This means it's not a study testing a new drug or treatment that typically goes through phases. It's more of an observational study or evaluation.\n        *   **Status:** `Recruiting` – This study is **currently looking for participants or collecting data**.\n\n    *   **`NCT04476680: Influence of Military Preventive Policy for reCruit Training on COVID-19 Seroconversion`**\n        *   **In Simple Terms:** This study is investigating how effective the COVID-19 prevention policies in the military are, particularly for new recruits, and how these policies affect whether recruits get infected.\n        *   **Phases:** `Not Applicable` – Again, this isn't a drug trial, but rather a study evaluating the impact of policies.\n        *   **Status:** `Recruiting` – This study is **currently looking for participants or collecting data**.\n\n    *   **`NCT04452682: The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Critical Limb Threatening Ischemia and Emergency Vascular Practice`**\n        *   **In Simple Terms:** This study has finished and was looking into how the COVID-19 pandemic affected people with serious leg circulation problems (called Critical Limb Threatening Ischemia) and how emergency blood vessel doctors (vascular practice) had to adapt their work during the pandemic.\n        *   **Phases:** `None` – This was likely an observational study or review, not a new treatment trial.\n        *   **Status:** `Completed` – This study has **finished collecting all its data**. Researchers are now analyzing the results, and eventually, the findings will be published.\n\n---\n\n### Key Terms Explained:\n\n*   **Phases (None/Not Applicable):** In many clinical trials, especially those testing new medications or treatments, studies go through \"phases\" (Phase 1, 2, 3, 4) to make sure they are safe and effective. However, for these specific examples, you see `None` or `Not Applicable`. This means these aren't trials testing a new drug or device in the traditional sense. Instead, they are often **observational studies, policy evaluations, or surveys** that don't fit into those traditional drug-testing phases. It doesn't mean they're incomplete or less important; just a different *type* of research.\n\n*   **Status:**\n    *   **`Recruiting`:** The study is actively looking for people to join, or is currently gathering information/data.\n    *   **`Completed`:** The study has finished gathering all its information. Researchers are now analyzing the data, and results will be shared later.\n\n---\n\n**In essence, this information shows that a wide range of research is happening to understand COVID-19 better – not just new treatments, but also how it spreads, how policies affect it, and its impact on other health conditions. If a study is \"Recruiting,\" it means they might be looking for volunteers, and if you're interested, you could look it up using the NCT number.**\n\n## Trial Status Chart\nPlot saved at: `trial_status.png`\n\n## Medical Disclaimer\nThis report is generated by an AI agent and is not medical advice.\nAlways consult a licensed healthcare professional.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":29}]}
